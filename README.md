### This Spring Boot application demonstrates the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization. JWT is used for secure, stateless user access, making it efficient for communication between the client and server.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

## Spring Boot:
### Framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.

## Spring Security:
### Provides authentication, authorization, and other security features.

## JSON Web Token (JWT):
### Compact and self-contained format for transmitting information between parties.

## USER AUTHENTICATION:
### Validates user credentials (username and password). Generates a JWT upon successful authentication.

## TOKEN GENERATION:
### JWT contains encoded user details and roles. JWT is signed with a secret key to ensure integrity.

## TOKEN STORAGE:
### The client stores the JWT for subsequent requests.

## TOKEN SUBMISSION:
### The client includes JWT in the request header for authentication.

## TOKEN VALIDATION:
### The server verifies the JWT's signature and decodes its content.

## AUTHORIZATION:
### The server checks user roles and permissions for resource access
